Please see the UMass Degree Programs webpage for more information on courses offered through the Natural Resources Conservation major at UMass Amherst.

I also co-lead the UMass Amherst Bioinformatics & Big Data in Biology User Group and associated graduate student journal club with Dr. Courtney Babbit. We currently meet ~monthly to share ideas, resources and work on data problems together. We are also developing other opportunities such as workshops and trainings, and maintain an active Slack community and listserv that is open to anyone in the UMass community to join. If you are interested in learning more, please contact our student rep, Nadia Fernandez: nbfernandezATumass.edu.

#### <u>Workshops</u>

All tutorials and presentations are here from our workshop in Non-model RNA-Seq analysis at Scripps Institution of Oceanography (UC San Diego) October 11-12th, 2017.
