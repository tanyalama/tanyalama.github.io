### <u>National Institutes of Health IRACDA<u>

#### <u>Past Courses</u>

Dr. Lama completed the <a href="https://blogs.umass.edu/applyteachfellows/">UMass College of Natural Sciences Teaching Fellowship</a> in 2018. Led my Dr. Elizabeth Jakobs and the Center for Integrated Research, Teaching and Learning, fellows gain teaching pedagogy training and faculty mentorship while designing their own course. As instructor of record, Dr. Lama led two sections of a conservation biology-focused First Year Seminar (a maximum of 19 Exploratory Track freshmen) in a graded seminar which met once per week in Fall 2018. Her course incorporated mini-lectures with active learning strategies, as one of the Universityâ€™s goals with this program was to give the students a chance to interact with each other and build a sense of community. 

Dr. Lama served as the instructor-of-record of the following courses at UMass Amherst:

Please see the UMass Degree Programs webpage for more information on courses offered through the Natural Resources Conservation major at UMass Amherst.

I also co-lead the UMass Amherst Bioinformatics & Big Data in Biology User Group and associated graduate student journal club with Dr. Courtney Babbit. We currently meet ~monthly to share ideas, resources and work on data problems together. We are also developing other opportunities such as workshops and trainings, and maintain an active Slack community and listserv that is open to anyone in the UMass community to join. If you are interested in learning more, please contact our student rep, Nadia Fernandez: nbfernandezATumass.edu.
