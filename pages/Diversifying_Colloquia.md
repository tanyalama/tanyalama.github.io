#### <u>Re-defining colloquia: A necessary step toward a more diverse and equitable academy<u>
Dr. Lama outlined a broadening participation initiative in her <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2010853&HistoricalAwards=false">successful NSF PRFB proposal</a>. 

The initiative, inspired by Dr. Lama's participation as a graduate student in the <a href="https://blogs.umass.edu/bridge/">UMass BRIDGE program</a>, proposes a re-imagination of departmental colloquia, geared to highlight the contributions of minority early-career researchers. Traditional academic colloquia provide a platform for research, which has proven adequate for historically included and well-represented scholars. However, such platforms fail to _acknowledge and celebrate_ the outsized service burdens undertaken by historically excluded (e.g., Black, Latinx, LGBTQ+) minority scholars. Therefore, re-definition of (1) whom is invited and (2) what is presented at departmental colloquia is a neccessary step toward equity. We propose a "goal-oriented" approach to inviting speakers, and a "lead-by-example" approach to normalizing the inclusion of DEIJ contributions in colloquia. 

Thus far, these approaches have resulted in a major departure from Stony Brook's traditionally research-focused colloquium. The Spring 2021 colloquium included 9/13 URM speakers, three of which focused on teaching and service rather than research -- a first for the department. This effort increases the visibility of underrepresented scientists, combats the attrition of underrepresented graduate students, and allows early career scientists to establish collaborations at a leading research university. 

We have compiled <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eR0Q8R1Dk2iPP__fIKWOqptL-5varoDixBTafnd8RLI/edit?usp=sharing">an open-source list of scholars</a> who self-identify as both (1) members of an under-represented minority group in academia and (2) early-career (pre-tenure). 
  
**If you would like to be invited to speak at the Fall 2021 departmental colloquium, please contact Dr. Lama.**
