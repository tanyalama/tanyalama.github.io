#### <u>Re-defining academic colloquia<u>
Dr. Lama's broadening participation initiative to diversify and redefine colloquia
As an associate fellow of the <a href="https://www.stonybrook.edu/commcms/cie/iracda/about/">NIH IRACDA (Institutional Research and Academic Career Development Award) program</a>, Dr. Lama receives supplementary research funding and teaching pedagogy development led by the Center for Inclusive Education at SUNY Stony Brook. This includes a 3-year mentored fellowship at Stony Brook University and teaching experience as instructor-of-record at minority-serving Partner Institutions:  CUNY Brooklyn College, SUNY College at Old Westbury and Suffolk County Community College. Dr. Lama will complete the teaching component of her NIH IRACDA fellowship in the <a href="https://doccs.ny.gov/college-programs">NY College Prison Education Program</a> in 2022. 
  
#### <u>UMass Amherst College of Natural Sciences Teaching Fellow</u>

Dr. Lama completed the <a href="https://blogs.umass.edu/applyteachfellows/">UMass College of Natural Sciences Teaching Fellowship</a> in 2018. Led my Dr. Elizabeth Jakobs and the Center for Integrated Research, Teaching and Learning, fellows gain teaching pedagogy training and faculty mentorship while designing their own course. As instructor of record, Dr. Lama led two sections of a conservation biology-focused First Year Seminar (a maximum of 19 Exploratory Track freshmen) in a graded seminar which met once per week in Fall 2018. Her course incorporated mini-lectures with active learning strategies, as one of the Universityâ€™s goals with this program was to give the students a chance to interact with each other and build a sense of community. 

#### <u>Past Courses</u>

##### BIO 494LI Life After Biology
This 1-credit course fulfills one component of the General Education Integrative Experience requirement for Biology majors. The course is designed to help students reflect on their academic training and prepare for multiple career trajectories. Students learn about career options for life scientists and develop strategies and skills to position themselves to be successful. In order to satisfy the Integrative Experience requirement, BA-Biol and BS-Biol majors must also take one of the approved 3- or 4-credit Biology courses listed on their Academic Requirements Report.

Please see the UMass Degree Programs webpage for more information on courses offered through the Natural Resources Conservation major at UMass Amherst.

I also co-lead the UMass Amherst Bioinformatics & Big Data in Biology User Group and associated graduate student journal club with Dr. Courtney Babbit. We currently meet ~monthly to share ideas, resources and work on data problems together. We are also developing other opportunities such as workshops and trainings, and maintain an active Slack community and listserv that is open to anyone in the UMass community to join. If you are interested in learning more, please contact our student rep, Nadia Fernandez: nbfernandezATumass.edu.

#### <u>Workshops</u>

All tutorials and presentations are here from our workshop in Non-model RNA-Seq analysis at Scripps Institution of Oceanography (UC San Diego) October 11-12th, 2017.
